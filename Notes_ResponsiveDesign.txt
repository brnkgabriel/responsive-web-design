- A breakpoint is the width in which the website changes layout based on the media query declaration
The most commonly used breakpoints are:
1. Extra small devices (xs): Phones (<768px)
2. Small devices (sm): Tablets (>= 768px and < 992px)
3. Medium devices (md): Desktop computers (>= 992px < 1200px)
4. Large devices (lg): Desktop computers & TVs (>= 1200px)

- A state is the version of the site in between each breakpoint. Mobile, tablet & desktop are our state
